        "1. **Convert to lowercase:** To ensure consistency, convert all the values to lowercase. This helps avoid duplicates due to different letter casing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Remove leading/trailing spaces:** Trim any leading or trailing spaces from the values to prevent discrepancies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Standardize synonyms:** Identify synonyms and replace them with a common term. For example, \"Pharmaceuticals\" and \"Pharmaceutical Industry\" can be standardized to \"Pharmaceuticals.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Handle variations:** Some entries may have minor variations, such as different spellings or pluralization. You can use string manipulation functions or regular expressions to group similar terms. For instance, \"E-commerce\" and \"ECommerce\" can be standardized to \"E-commerce.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Categorize into broader groups:** Group related industries into broader categories. This could involve creating a mapping dictionary that assigns each specific industry to a broader category.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Create a new column:** After cleaning, create a new column (e.g., \"cleaned_industry\") to store the cleaned and categorized values.\n",
